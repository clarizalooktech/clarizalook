                        <p>As a developer, my passion continues to grow every day as I embark on my lifelong journey of learning. I am eager to take part in and contribute to building something that adds value to the end users.</p>

                        <p>In my previous experience as a senior marketing consultant, I relished the opportunity to identify root problems, build great relationships with people, and develop technical aspects of my current role. I possess an attention to detail, the ability to work with different teams and people, and a mindset geared towards developing scalable processes. I hope to bring my experiences, problem-solving skills, and positive energy to the start of my new career as a devops engineer and developer.</p>

                        <p>Besides work, I am a beach bum who loves prestine beaches, sunsets, reggae music, food and cocktails as well as a travel & culture enthusiast (a person who is curious, appreciates diversity, and loves learning new things).ðŸ˜¸</p>
