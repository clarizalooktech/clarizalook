This project serves as my portfolio website, developed using the Node.js framework to demonstrate my knowledge in NodeJs (Javascript) application development and devops (for deploying the application in AWS - Amazon Web Services Platform).

As a devops engineer and a software developer, my passion continues to grow every day as I embark on my lifelong journey of learning. I am eager to take part in and contribute to building something that adds value to the end users.

In my previous experience as a senior marketing consultant, I relished the opportunity to identify root problems, build great relationships with people, and develop technical aspects of my current role. I possess an attention to detail, the ability to work with different teams and people, and a mindset geared towards developing scalable processes. I hope to bring my experiences, problem-solving skills, and positive energy to the start of my career as a devops engineer and software developer.

Besides work, I am a beach bum who loves prestine beaches, sunsets, reggae music, food and cocktails.ðŸ˜¸
